This is the code for generating Magnify-SOFI images. 

The code needs Needs Bio-formats to run. Download and install here: https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/downloads/
The code also needs MicroscPSF.m  from https://github.com/MicroscPSF/MicroscPSF-Matlab.

Helper functions in the /funcs folder are also needed to run the code. 

SOFI_batch works with .nd2 data and outputs 2ed and 3rd order SOFI images for 2D and 3D data as tif stacks.
